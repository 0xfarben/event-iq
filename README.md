    <link href='https://api.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/v2.10.0/mapbox-gl.css' rel='stylesheet'/>
  ```
   - Initialize MapBox with your token in your JavaScript code:
  ```javascript
    mapboxgl.accessToken = 'YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN';
    const map = new mapboxgl.Map({
        container: 'map', // ID of the HTML element to display the map
        style: 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v11', // Map style
        center: [longitude, latitude], // Starting position [lng, lat]
        zoom: 12 // Starting zoom level
    });
  ```
    
1.4. Set up the required Environment Variables

## Event Scraping

The platform scrapes event data daily from various event listing websites using **Python** scripts. These scripts fetch event details like title, description, location, and date and save them into MongoDB via **Cosmocloud's API**.

### Scraped Websites:
- **Luma.ai**
- **Eventbrite**
- **All-Events**
- **Reskill**
- **Google Developers**
- **Meetup**

### Scraping Process:
1. Each website has its own dedicated script to scrape event data.
2. Data is normalized into a common format with fields like `title`, `description`, `category`, `date`, `location`, `price`, and `tags`.
3. Scraped data is sent via a **POST** request to Cosmocloud, which saves it into MongoDB for storage and future retrieval.
4. A daily cron job on the VPS triggers the scraping scripts and ensures up-to-date event listings.

## Cosmocloud Integration

We used **Cosmocloud** for the following:

### 1. **Event Data Management:**
   - Cosmocloud serves as an intermediary to store and retrieve event data via its APIs.
   - The backend makes **POST** requests to Cosmocloud to save new event data scraped from websites.

### 2. **User Data Storage:**
   - User information (name, email, profile image, registered events) is stored in MongoDB through Cosmocloud's APIs.
   - When users sign up, their data is saved by making a POST request to the Cosmocloud API endpoint for user management.

### 3. **Object Storage:**
   - Event images and user profile pictures are uploaded to Cosmocloud's Object Storage.
   - A **GET** request to Cosmocloud retrieves the image URL, which is saved in MongoDB under the `profileImage` field for users or event images for events.
     
### 4. **Embedding Generation:**
   - The project utilizes Gemini to generate embeddings for events and user interests. This process involves the following steps:
      
   - Data Preparation:
    Relevant data points, such as event descriptions, categories, and user interests, are collected and preprocessed. This may include tokenization, normalization, and vectorization to ensure that the input data is in a suitable format for the embedding generation process.
    The preprocessed data is fed into the Gemini model, which leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to transform this information into numerical vectors (embeddings). Each embedding captures the semantic meaning and context of the data, allowing      for a more nuanced understanding of events and user preferences.

  - Integration with Search and Recommendation Systems:
    Once generated, these embeddings are stored in the database and used to enhance search functionality and personalized recommendations. When a user searches for events or expresses their interests, the system can match the userâ€™s embedding against event embeddings,         identifying the most relevant and personalized options based on the underlying patterns in the data.

  - Continuous Improvement:
    As more user interactions and event data accumulate, the embeddings can be regularly updated, allowing the system to learn and adapt over time, further improving the accuracy of search results and recommendations.

## Routes

### User Routes

1. **POST `/signup`**:
   - Registers a new user with details like name, email, and profile image.
   - After successful registration, the user is redirected to fill in their interests.

2. **POST `/login`**:
   - Authenticates the user using Firebase Authentication.
   - Checks whether the user has saved any interests; if not, they are redirected to the interest page.

3. **POST `/save-interests`**:
   - Saves the user's interests to MongoDB.

4. **GET `/dashboard`**:
   - Fetches user-specific data, including registered events, from Cosmocloud, and displays them on the dashboard.

5. **POST `/register-event`**:
   - Registers a user for an event. The event details are saved under the `registered_events` field in the user's record in MongoDB.

### Event Routes

1. **GET `/events`**:
   - Retrieves event data from Cosmocloud, including filters for category, location, and date.

2. **POST `/save-event`**:
   - Saves new event data to MongoDB via Cosmocloud's API after it is scraped from event websites.

3. **GET `/event/:id`**:
   - Fetches detailed information about a single event based on its ID.

## Usage

1. **User Sign Up & Login**: Users can sign up using a simple registration form or through Firebase login. Once logged in, they can update their interests or proceed directly to the dashboard if interests are already saved.

2. **Personalized Event Recommendations**: Once the user has set their preferences, the platform fetches event recommendations tailored to their interests using **Gemini AI**.

3. **Event Management**: Users can register for events, view event details, and access a map link for directions to the event venue.

4. **Dashboard**: The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the userâ€™s registered events, upcoming events, and allows for easy navigation through their personalized events list.
